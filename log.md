# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Basic setup of Webpack (inc. HMR) and VueJS.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out how my project setup is going to be.

**Duration:** 1u40

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Further setup of Webpack and VueJS, now using Gulp to start webpack-dev-server. Also improved my project setup a little.

**Thoughts:** Getting vue-loader and webpack dev server using gulp to work is harder than expected.. Got webpack and vue-loader working together but when I tried to use gulp for it, it always failed. Tomorrow I'm going to look further into it.

**Duration:** 2u30

### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed HMR (hot module reload) with Webpack and Vuejs (vue-loader) staring from Gulp. #happy

**Thoughts:** Before thinking something is too hard (like I was thinking yesterday), I really have to be more attentive when reading the documentation of something.. Because the solution of my problem, was declared in the documentation of Webpack.

**Duration:** 2u
