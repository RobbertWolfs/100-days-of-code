# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Basic setup of Webpack (inc. HMR) and VueJS.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out how my project setup is going to be.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Further setup of Webpack and VueJS, now using Gulp to start webpack-dev-server. Also improved my project setup a little.

**Thoughts:** Getting vue-loader and webpack dev server using gulp to work is harder than expected.. Got webpack and vue-loader working together but when I tried to use gulp for it, it always failed. Tomorrow I'm going to look further into it.
