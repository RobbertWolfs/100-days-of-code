# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Basic setup of Webpack (inc. HMR) and VueJS.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out how my project setup is going to be.

**Duration:** 1u40

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Further setup of Webpack and VueJS, now using Gulp to start webpack-dev-server. Also improved my project setup a little.

**Thoughts:** Getting vue-loader and webpack dev server using gulp to work is harder than expected.. Got webpack and vue-loader working together but when I tried to use gulp for it, it always failed. Tomorrow I'm going to look further into it.

**Duration:** 2u30

### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed HMR (hot module reload) with Webpack and Vuejs (vue-loader) staring from Gulp. #happy

**Thoughts:** Before thinking something is too hard (like I was thinking yesterday), I really have to be more attentive when reading the documentation of something.. Because the solution of my problem, was declared in the documentation of Webpack.

**Duration:** 2u

### Day 4: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some reading on VueJS and did some basic styling like typography and colors.

**Duration:** 1u30

**Thoughts:** Today was more about information than coding.

### Day 5: Januari 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some more styling of my vinyl component.

### Day 6: Januari 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today was longer than expected. First part of today I was reading the VueJS docs about components and the vue-router, the second part of today I was trying to implement a basic router to my project.

**Duration:** 2u30

**Thoughts:** Struggled more with the vue-router than expected. Trying to combine the router with vue components was not that easy. Have a basic sample working, but needs to be re-evaluated tomorrow.

### Day 7: Januari 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved the routing setup. Also played with some vue transition. Had some trouble with CSS today, so I reverted it. So I can try it again tomorrow with a fresh start.

**Duration:** 2u15

**Thoughts:** Still not totally understanding my new routing setup, got some inspiration of [this setup](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0). Going to look at this setup again when I have a better understanding of VueJS. Also noticed my css knowledge is not always what it should be. So this also needs some improvement.

### Day 8: Januari 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I did not much coding, because I have to give a presentation friday, I decided to give one about the subject I'm learning during this challenge. So today was more about watching videos to fully understand the basics of VueJS, with the mandatory notes and code snippets. So if my notes count I still have "coded" today..

**Thoughts:** Step by step getting to know VueJS better. Giving a presentation about it on Friday will make me understand it even more I guess.


### Day 9: Januari 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my slides for my presentation tomorrow. Tried my coding samples a couple of times to see if I can fully understand what I'm talking about. 

**Thoughts:** VueJS looks awesome :) 


### Day 10: Januari 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today was a bad day, did not make much progress.. Did some css layout and tried some transitions between two routes. 

**Duration:** 1u30

**Thoughts:** Have to do more research on vuejs routes and transitions.. Going to read more of the documentation tomorrow..

### Day 11: Januari 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played some more with transitions and routings. Got some more progress today. Result still not what it should be.

**Duration:** 2u

**Thoughts:** After some while I noticed I just forgot some css to make it work...

### Day 13: Januari 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with html5 canvas. Tried to create a record using canvas. [First approach](http://imgur.com/a/1PHus) looks nice.

**Duration:** 1u30

**Thoughts:** Canvas is less difficult than I thought. Still some complex stuff at some times. Going to look at it more tomorrow.

### Day 14: Januari 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today experimented with [mo.js](http://mojs.io/). 

**Duration:** 2u

**Thoughts:** Mojs is an awesome library for creating web animations. Still need to investigate it more for more complex animations.
